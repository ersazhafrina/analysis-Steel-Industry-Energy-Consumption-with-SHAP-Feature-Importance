# analysis-Steel-Industry-Energy-Consumption-with-SHAP-Feature-Importance
This portfolio is made for the Final Project of Bootcamp Data Science. The Source Code will explain in Bahasa. This Project is analyzing about What factors most influence the Type of Energy Load, What Factor which triggered an energy load that is classified as a maximum load, how effectively the energy load has been consumed.

# Dataset Information
This dataset is data on the energy load consumed by DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd  for 1 year (2018)

# Objective
Energy consumption is one of the important aspects in the industrial world. The more effectively the energy is consumed, the more efficient the costs incurred. This project presents an analysis of what factors most influence the Type of Energy Load and What Factor which triggers an energy load that is classified as a maximum load also predict the Type of Energy Load to analyze how effectively the energy load has been consumed

# Attribute Information
1. Date â€“ datetime per 15 minutes
2. Usage_kWh = Industry Energy Consumption - Continuous (kWh)
3. Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh = Lagging Current reactive power - Continuous (kVarh)
4. Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh = Leading Current reactive power - Continuous (kVarh)
5. CO2(tCO2) = rate of CO2(CO2) - Continuous (ppm)
6. Lagging_Current_Power_Factor = Lagging Current power factor -Continuous (%)
7. Leading_Current_Power_Factor = Leading Current Power factor Continuous - (%)
8. NSM  = Number of Seconds from midnight Continuous - (s)
9. WeekStatus= Week status - Categorical (Weekend (0) or a Weekday(1))
10. Day_of_week= Day of week - Categorical Monday to Sunday
11. Load_Type= Load Type - Categorical Light Load, Medium Load, Maximum Load
